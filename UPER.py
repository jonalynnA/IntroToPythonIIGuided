# Return the " centered" average of an array of ints, which we'll say is the
# mean average of the values, except ignoring the largest and smallest values
# in the array

# centered_avereage([1, 2, 3, 4, 100]) -> 3
# centered_average([1, 1, 5, 5, 10, 8, 7]) -> 5
# centered_average([-10, -4, -2, -4, -2, 0]) -> -3

# What about multiple smallest values?
# Just ignore one of them

# How large?
# No limit

# Speed issues?
# No worries

# All INTs?
# Yes

# Fewer than 3 elements?
# Will always be 3 or more

# Number size:
# Arbitrarily large

# Can I use other libraries?
# No

# Will the list always be sorted?
# No
